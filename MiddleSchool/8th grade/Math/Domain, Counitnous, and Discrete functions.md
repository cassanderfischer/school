# Domain, Continuous, and Discrete

## What is discrete?

Discrete is a word to describe data on a graph, specifically lines and dots.
### Example 1
![discrete graph](discrete%20graph.drawio.png)

This is an example of a discrete graph. The reason why this graph is discrete is because there is only dots, no lines.
### Example 2

```
Joan earns a starting salary of $30,000 per year.
She will receive a raise of $2,500 per year for the first 10 years.
```

In this word problem your are counting the money. You are counting the thing that is being graphed. When count the thing that is graphed, it will be discrete. 

## What is continuous?

Continuous is the opposite of discrete
### Example 1
![continuous graph](continuous%20graph.drawio.png)

This is an example of a continuous graph. It is continuous because there is a solid line. No dots.

### Example 2

```
The freeway construction crew pours 300 feet of concrete in a day.
```

This is continuous because you are measuring, not counting.
