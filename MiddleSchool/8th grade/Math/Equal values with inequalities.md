# Equal values with inequalities

## Example

y= 3x+5
y=4x+8

3x+5=4x+8
-3x  -3x
5=x+8
-8  -8
-3=x
x=-3

(Replace x with -3) 3(3)+5=14

(-3,14)

These equations are used to find the point of intersection without using a graph. First you need to write down one of the y equations, and then equal sign, second y equation.
Once you solve that equation, you will know what x is. Now you need to find y. All you need to do to find y is replace x with it's real value in any of the y equations. Now you have the intersection of x and y.
