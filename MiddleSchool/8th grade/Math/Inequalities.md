# Inequalities

## Starter inequality
v-15=-27
+15  +15
v=-12

In these equations you want to get the letter by itself to know what it equals. In order to do that you have to get rid of the number next to the letter. In our example problem we had to add fifteen to get rid of negative fifteen, but remember to always do the same thing on both sides. After you cancel out the number next to the letter, the number on the other side of the equation will also change.

8x=-104
/8   /8
x=-13

This equation is a little bit different. Here the number with x is right next to it, so this means the only way to cancel it out is to divide, because if the number is right next the letter that means they are being multiplied, and the only thing that can cancel out multiplication is division.

## Equations with parenthesis
```
2(n+5)=-2

2n+10=-2
  -10 -10

2n=-12
/2  /2

n=-6
```
In this equation there are parenthesis. When there are parenthesis you have to multiply every number and the letter inside the parenthesis by the number to the left of the parenthesis.
 
## Inequalities from word problems
Cassander can have 2 muffins before a soccer game at most.
$$x\le2$$

In equations for those word problems, x is what is being measured. In this example, the things being measured are muffins. Since he is eating 2 muffins or less 2 has to be greater than or equal too.

## Inequalities from word problems part two

Luke wants an average of at least 275 on his first 3 games of bowling. In his first two games he scored 289 and 260.

$$\frac{289+260+x}{3}\ge275$$

We first need to count how many games he is doing. We divide that number by the scores and x. The we take the average that he want and put the more than or equal to sign.

## Inequality with two of the same letter and parenthesis

2bx+4b=20
/b(2x+4) /b(2x+4)

$$b=\frac{20}{(2x+4)}$$
$$b=\frac{20}{(1x+2)}$$

In these equations you need to do reverse distributive property.
