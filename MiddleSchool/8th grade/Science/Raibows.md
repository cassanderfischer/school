# How is a rainbow formed?

Rainbows only happen when it's raining and there is sun outside. When it's raining, the sun's light goes to the rain drops and the rain drops act as prisms. They break the sun's white light into a band of seven colors, which are the ones we see on the rainbow. The light bends slightly in different angles, this is what makes different colors appear. The colors with the most wave lengths are at the top of the rainbow, while the colors with the shortest wave length are at the bottom of the rainbow.
