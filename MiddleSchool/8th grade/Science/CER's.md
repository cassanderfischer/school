# CER's

CER's are used during experiments with the following parts:

Evidence- This is where you share data. You must give specific data in your evidence section. This means you will usually reference multiple pieces of evidence.

There are two types of data used:
      Qualitative-describes the qualities of something. Example: furry, soft, tall
      Quantitative-describes a quantity and includes a label. Example: 12 meters, 6ml

      Sentence starters:
        According to the data table...
        The results of "x" shows us that...
        When analyzing the data, I found that..

Reasoning- Connects the evidence, the claim and shows how the evidence supports your claim. Includes principles that are generally scientific facts that have been given or stated previously in class.
       
       Sentence starters:
           According to the scientific principle "x"______. We can see this in our evidence where (references the data). This tells us that (make connection to the claim). 
          In my data I saw(a piece of evidence). This tells us that "x" because (applicable scientific principle).
