# How do I stay in shape?

## What are my Priorities? 
My priorities are to be healthy and strong. The keys are to eat well and to exercise. 
Eating well means choosing the right food, eating the food in the right order, and knowing why you're eating the food you eat. 
Exercising has to be at the right time and using different exercises to strengthen different body parts.

## Why am I gaining weight?
By not eating properly, we are ingesting too much glucose in our body. During the digestion the body is producing insulin in order to absorb glucose.
It's then being stored as energy and/or into fat. The more glucose, the more fat is stored.

## Concept

Most of my eating habits are coming from the book [The Glucose Revolution](https://www.glucosegoddess.com/books).

In this book the author explains how to keep your glucose level low. This is key to avoid creating fat and use the protein eaten to create muscles.

Keys to eating well are:
1. Eating fiber
2. Eating protein
3. Eating carbs
4. Being active in the hour after eating
5. Drink a glass of water with apple cider before and during the meal.

### What food should I eat?

#### Food containing fiber

Fiber is important for the body because it:
- Keeps your digestion moving and helps your body get rid of waste.
- Helps to keep your gut healthy and may even protect the cells of your gut.
- Provides food for the microbes in your gut. These microbes digest the fiber you eat and turn it into healthy small molecules.
- Is essential for proper bowel movement. It absorbs water and helps in softening stools.
- Helps lower glucose levels as well as help lower blood cholesterol.

Foods with fiber are:
- carrots
- berries
- beans
- broccoli
- avocados
- nuts

Why is fiber good for you, you may ask. Well some types of fiber can help lose weight. 
Healthline says, "Fiber can soak up water in the intestine, slowing the absorption of nutrients and increasing feelings of fullness"
Another quote from Healthline says that, "In fact, some studies show that increasing dietary fiber can cause weight loss by automatically reducing calorie intake".

"Children and adults need at least 25 to 35 grams of fiber per day for good health, but most Americans get only about 15 grams a day." Says Harvard T.H Chan. Keeping track of how much fiber you are having is a good thing to do to make sure you are having enough fiber per day.

#### Protein

Protein is good for muscle growth and for exercising. 

There are other specific reasons to eat protein:
- it will reduce appetite and hunger
- it is good for your bones
- it increases fat burning
- it helps to maintain weight loss
- it helps gaining muscle to stay in shape.

Food with protein are:
- meats (lamb, beef, pork, chicken, turkey, and fish)
- seafood (lobster, mussels, oysters, scallops, and clams)
- dairy can also have protein, cottage cheese and Greek yoghurt have the most protein out of all dairy.

Tip from Healthline: "If you need to lose weight or belly fat, consider replacing some of your carbs and fats with protein. It can be as simple as making your potato or rice serving smaller while adding a few extra bites of meat or fish.". 


### What order to eat it in?

Eating the food in a certain order is very important. 
It may not seem that important but it is when it comes to getting in shape. 

If you don't eat food in the right order, it may not benefit you as much as it could.
The simple order for eating a meal is:
1. Eat food rich in fiber
2. Eat food rich in protein
3. Eat the rest of your meal with the carbs 


### Want to lose more weight?

- Be active
  - Going for a walk during the hour after eating can lower the amount of glucose ingested in your body as some of it will be used by your body as energy during your walk.
  - Work out regularly, at least 30 minutes a day to create or maintain muscles.

- Drink apple cider vinegar: Per the book, drinking apple cider vinegar has a lot of [benefits](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/6-proven-health-benefits-of-apple-cider-vinegar#heart-health). 
Some studies have shown that one of them is weight loss (but you'd need to read the book to find which ones).

- Don't snack
- Don't skip breakfast (on days you eat)
- Fast


## My resolution

Every day, I will eat a breakfast rich in fiber (nuts) and protein (omelets with eggs, spinach and onion). I'll drink a glass of apple cider with it if I am getting oats or pancakes as well.
For lunch, I will also eat food rich in fiber and protein (fish with Brussel sprouts, broccoli) as well as a little bit of pasta with pesto. Plus I'd had some pistachio and seeds in it. The pasta will be used during my workout.
If I am hungry I'll eat a light dinner or else, I'll fast. The body will burn more fat when in [ketosis](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/ideal-ketosis-level-for-weight-loss).
For food I'll make sure to use mostly the kind [that increases levels of testosterone](https://www.ripfast.com/brussels-sprouts-for-testosterone) as it will help build muscles.
