# Measures of center

Data set example: 3, 7, 5, 9, 13, 15, 17, 24

1st step is to organize all the numbers smallest to biggest. 

3, 5, 7, 9, 13, 15, 17, 24

## Calculations:

### Mean: Average. 

To find the average, you need to find the total amount of all numbers added together and then divide that number by the amount of numbers in the data set.
3+5+7+9+13+15+17+24=93
93/8=11.6

### Median

The median is the middle number. If you have two middle numbers, than add both of them then divide by 2.
9+13=22
22/2=11

### Mode:

 The mode is the most common number in the set. A way to remember that is to no that the words mode and most start with "m" and "o". It is possible to have more than one mode. It is also possible to have no mode.
The example has no mode.

### Minimum: 

The minimum is the lowest number in the data set.
The lowest number in the example is 3.

### Maximum: 

The maximum is the biggest number in the data set.
The biggest number in the example is 24.

### Range:

 The range is the maximum minus the minimum.
The range in the example is 21.

### Quartile 1: 
To find the Quartile 1, you need to know the median.
- Split the data set in half: 3, 5, 7, 9
- The 1st quartile is the median of that half: 6.5
The quartile 1 in the example is 6.5

### Quartile 3:
 Quartile 3 is the median of the second half of the data set. To find the quartile 3 you need to do what you did during the first quartile.
- Split the data set in half: 13, 15, 17, 24
- Find the median of the second half: 16
  The quartile 3 in the example is 16
