## Cones and Cylinders

- volume for cones 

![cone](images/cones.drawio.png)
$$
volume=\cfrac{r * r * \pi * h} { 3}
$$

- volume for cylinders

![cylinder](images/cylinder.drawio.png)
$$
volume=r * r * \pi * h
$$

- Relation between cones and cylinders
A cylinder is 3 times as much as a cone. A cylinder has the same base and height of a cone. 
When a question says that _a cone has a volume of 28 and asks for the volume of the cylinder with similar radius (base) and height_.
The answer is that the volume of the cylinder is 28*3=84


- Working backwards: finding the radius when you know the volume and the height
  Using the example
![cylinder](images/working-backwards1.drawio.png)
$volume = 300in^3$
 1. Use the numbers you know, such as the given volume, the height, and pi to write the formula. 
$volume=r * r * \pi * h$
Then replace with the values
$300 = r^2 * 3.14 * 8$
 1. Divide the volume by the height first. 

$37.5 = r^2 * 3.14$

 3. Divide the new volume by pi.

 $11.94 = r^2$

 4.  . All thats left is the new volume and the unknown radius. In order to get the radius you need to find the root of it. Remember, you are multiplying the radius twice, that is why you need to find the root. Use a calculator for this part. Root looks like this, 
  $\sqrt{\smash[b]{r^2}}$

5. The calculator now gives you the value of r.
