## Rounding

## Rounding to the nearest tenth
In order to round to the nearest tenth you need to look at the hundredth. If it is 5 or above then round up, if it's below 5, round down.

 If we have 9.564, the tenth place is 5. Now we need to look at the hundredth. That would be 6. 6 is higher than 5, so we round up.

 9.564 becomes 9.6.

 If our decimal was 9.544, than we would go down. 9.544 is 9.5.
